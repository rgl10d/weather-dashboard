# Weather Dashboard

## Description
A weather dashboard that finds the current weather of any given city in the world through the OpenWeather API; this includes today's date, the temperature, humidity, wind speed and the UV index.
A forecast for the next 5 days is also displayed with the temperature and humidity.

## Usage
Simply type in an existing city name and hit the search button and the information will fill the screen! The UV index is also dynamically color coded relative to how dangerous the UV rays are
that day; they mean the following:
- Green: Index ranges from 0-2.99.
- Yellow: Index ranges from 3-5.99.
- Orange: Index ranges from 6-7.99.
- Red: Index ranges from 8-10.
